        Have you ever felt worried that your party will not raise up to your guest expectations? In design, vertical rhythm is the structure that guides a reader's eye through the content. Good vertical rhythm makes a layout more balanced and beautiful and its
        content more readable. The time signature in sheet music visually depicts a song's rhythm, while for us, the lines of the baseline grid depict the rhythm of our content and give us guidelines.
